    <h1> What is ITIL?</h1>

    <p>
      ITIL is the most widely accepted approach to IT Service Management in the world, and is used globally by millions of practitioners.
    </p>
    <p>For over 25 years, ITIL has been providing organisations with a practical guidance to improve IT services.
      ITIL is fundamental to businesses, enables transformation and helps organisations realize value.</p>

    <p>The last version of the framework, ITIL 4, is built on established ITSM practices and expands itself to
      the wider context of customer experience, value streams and digital transformation, as well as embracing
      new ways of working, such as Lean, Agile, and DevOps.</p>
