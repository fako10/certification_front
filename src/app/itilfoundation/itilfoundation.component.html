    <h1> ITIL Foundation Practice Tests</h1>
    <p><h2>Contents</h2>
    The ITIL Foundation package contains 5 complete tests (totalling to 200 questions).


    <p><h2>Taking The Practice Tests</h2>

    <br>
    <p>Just like the real exam, you must complete a test in 60 minutes. You may choose to have an untimed test.
      You can also choose to review the questions one by one, untimed, and answers shown. </p>
    <p>Also, just like the real exam, the passing score is 65% (that means, you must have answered correctly, at least 26 questions). </p>

    <p>Each complete test has:
    <ul>
      <li>1- 150 questions just like the real test</li>
      <li>2- full coverage (100%) of the test topics </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>The look and feel, and features of itestjava.com's ITIL practical test interface is similar to the real test interface at the testing centers. </p>

    <p><h2>Quality Of Practice Questions</h2>

    <p>Our questions are in similar level of difficulty as the real exam questions. </p>
