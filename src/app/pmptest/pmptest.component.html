    <p><h2>Contents</h2>
    The PMP practice test package contains 5 complete tests (totalling to 900 questions).


    <p><h2>Taking The Practice Tests</h2>

    <br>
    <p>Just like the real exam, you must complete a test in 230 minutes. You may choose to have an untimed test.
      You can also choose to review the questions one by one, untimed, and answers shown. </p>

    <p>Each complete test has:
    <ul>
      <li>1- 180 questions just like the real test</li>
      <li>2- full coverage (100%) of the test topics </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>The look and feel, and features of itestjava.com's PMP practical test interface is similar to the real test interface at the testing centers. </p>

    <p><h2>Quality Of Practice Questions</h2>

    <p>Our questions are in similar level of difficulty as the real exam questions. </p>
